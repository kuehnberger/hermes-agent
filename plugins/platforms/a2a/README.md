# A2A — Agent-to-Agent protocol for Hermes

Talk to other agents, and let other agents talk to you, over the open
[A2A protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org) **v1.0**. Works with any A2A-compliant
peer (another Hermes, LangChain, CrewAI, Google ADK, OpenClaw, …). Stdlib only —
no `a2a-sdk` dependency.

## Enable

```bash
hermes gateway setup      # pick A2A, or:
```

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    a2a:
      enabled: true
      extra:
        port: 9900

# peers you want to call (outbound):
a2a_agents:
  researcher:
    url: "http://localhost:9999"
    auth: { type: bearer, token: "sk-..." }
    timeout: 120
    capabilities: [web_search, research]
```

## Outbound — call other agents

The agent gets six tools:

- `a2a_discover(url)` — what can this agent do?
- `a2a_call(agent, message, context_id?, wait?)` — send it a task, get the reply.
  `wait=false` is accept-then-poll: you get the task id back immediately instead of
  blocking for the whole job.
- `a2a_status(agent, task_id)` — poll a task (the read side of `wait=false`, and
  how you collect a result after the reply window elapsed).
- `a2a_list()` — configured peers, saved conversations, metrics.
- `a2a_history(context_id)` — recall a saved A2A conversation.
- `a2a_orchestrate(capability, message, mode?)` — fan-out a task to every
  peer advertising a capability (`all` / `first` / `best`).

**Long jobs:** a blocking `message/send` is bounded by `A2A_REPLY_TIMEOUT` and has no
early ack — the reply is bound to task completion. Jobs expected to outlive that window
must not use a blocking send: use `wait=false` / `configuration.returnImmediately=true`
and poll `tasks/get`, or hand the job off as a kanban card. A peer whose reply window
elapses first returns the task as `TASK_STATE_WORKING` with a poll hint (it is **not**
failed), and the eventual reply still lands in the task store.

## Inbound — be callable

When the `a2a` platform is enabled, Hermes serves a v1.0 Agent Card at
`http://<host>:<port>/.well-known/agent-card.json` (the legacy
`/.well-known/agent.json` path is also answered for pre-1.0 clients) and
accepts JSON-RPC
`message/send`, `message/stream` (SSE), `tasks/get|list|cancel|subscribe`,
and push notification configs (inline or via
`tasks/pushNotificationConfig/create`). Incoming tasks are injected into your
**live** agent session — the same agent that's talking to you, with full
memory — and the reply is returned over A2A. Completed tasks stay queryable
via `tasks/get`.

## Security

- **No token ⇒ localhost only.** The server binds `127.0.0.1` and refuses to
  widen unless you configure a token *and* set `A2A_HOST`.
- **Per-peer tokens**: `A2A_PEER_TOKENS="alice:tok1,bob:tok2"` gives each
  remote agent its own credential; that authenticated name (never anything
  in the request body) drives rate limiting, trust, and audit.
- Inbound text — including `/`-prefixed text — is run through
  prompt-injection filters and framed as untrusted peer input; remote peers
  cannot invoke operator slash commands.
- Outbound text is scrubbed of credential-shaped strings.
- Push callbacks are SSRF-guarded and HMAC-SHA256 signed (`X-A2A-Signature`).
- Every exchange is logged to `~/.hermes/a2a_audit.jsonl`.
- Conversations persist to `~/.hermes/a2a_conversations/` — they survive context
  compaction and restarts (`a2a_history` recalls them).

## Env vars

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `A2A_PEER_TOKENS` | _(unset)_ | Per-peer credentials `name:token,…` (preferred). |
| `A2A_BEARER_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Shared token; identity falls back to caller IP. |
| `A2A_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind host. Only widens with a token set. |
| `A2A_PORT` | `9900` | Inbound port. |
| `A2A_AGENT_NAME` | hostname-derived | Name on the Agent Card. |
| `A2A_PUBLIC_URL` | _(unset)_ | Routable URL advertised on the card (reverse proxies). |
| `A2A_TRUSTED_PEERS` | _(unset)_ | Allow-list of authenticated identities. Required for a non-loopback bind (with a token set) unless `A2A_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true`; otherwise dispatch is refused. |
| `A2A_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` | `false` | Allow any authed peer (dev only). |
| `A2A_RATE_LIMIT` | `60` | Requests/minute per identity. |
| `A2A_MAX_PINGPONG_TURNS` | `5` | Anti-loop turn cap per context (max 20). |
| `A2A_REPLY_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Seconds a *blocking* `message/send` waits for the agent's reply before it stops waiting (and hands the caller a pollable `TASK_STATE_WORKING` task). The orphan sweep never fails a task before this window (floor 300s) or while a request still waits on it. |
| `A2A_JOB_TIMEOUT` | `3600` | Seconds a task may stay non-terminal once nobody is waiting on its request (parked: reply window elapsed, or accepted via `returnImmediately`) before the watchdog fails it. The reply window bounds one request; this bounds the work. |
| `A2A_PUSH_SECRET` | bearer token | HMAC secret for push signing. |
| `A2A_ADVERTISED_TOOLSETS` | all registered | Restrict skills on the Agent Card. |
